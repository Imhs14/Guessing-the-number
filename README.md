# Guessing the Number Game

A simple, interactive command-line game built with Python where the computer selects a random number, and the player tries to guess it.

## 🎮 How it Works
The program generates a random number within a specific range (e.g., 1 to 100). The player is prompted to enter their guess, and the game provides feedback:
- **"Too High!"** if the guess is above the target.
- **"Too Low!"** if the guess is below the target.
- **"Congratulations!"** when the player guesses the correct number.

## ✨ Features
- **Random Number Generation:** Every game is different.
- **Interactive Feedback:** Helps the player narrow down the correct number.
- **Attempt Tracking:** (If implemented) Keeps track of how many guesses it took to win.
- **Simple & Lightweight:** Runs directly in your terminal.
